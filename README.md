# R-Final
This project helped me see how age and heart strength (ejection fraction) affect whether a person survives heart failure. Older people and those with weaker hearts were more likely to die. The charts and stats made the patterns easier to understand, and the tests showed the differences were real, not random. Overall, it was cool to see how data can actually help in real life.

In the screenshots I inculded, there are three visualizations shown. 

The first is a bar chart that shows the amout of death events for each age group.
The second is a scatter plot showing the correlation between ejection fraction and age. 
The third is a histogram of the distribution of ages in the dataset.
